### _*The Hardware and Software of Community service + sources*_ 

As easy as it is to believe, community service does include a lot of Hardware and Software. For the past few weeks, we have been collectively researching our topic regarding its advances in hardware and software and so far i have found that its very simple rather than complex for its extreme grey area. 

[hiver](https://hiverhq.com/blog/customer-support-tools) states that the majority of customers change brands after one negative experience with customer service, so they encourage the use and supplyment of hardware and software like [customer support tool](https://hiverhq.com/pricing) technology to help organize complaints, queries and requests. 
They also encourage the use of [help desk ticketing systems](https://hiverhq.com/helpdesk-alternatives) that allow customer service teams to log support tickets, streamline support workflows, automate the process of routing tickets to the right agents, and work collaboratively to reduce response time and deliver excellent customer service.

[liveagent](https://www.liveagent.com/academy/call-center-equipment/ ) states that the basic hardware a call center should have isâ€¦ 
1. Computers 
2. The latest Windows or Mac OS operating system.
3. At least 8 GB of RAM (more memory generally improves performance).
4. A hard disk space of about 280 GB.
5. Antivirus and spyware protection software.

And of course internet headsets and office space. 
  
In order to find these results I had to alter my searches and look from the perspective of a customer service worker trying to find hardware and software, which i found helped a lot. 

### _*Engineering Design Process*_ 

As i talked about in my last blog, the engineering design process is a system that people use to design new concepts, ideas, foundations and products. Over the course of this project, we use the engineering design process to create the foundation and finished proudct along with pinpoint where we are in terms of finishing. Currently we are on the second step of researchig the proble we are trying to solve. Eventually with the evidence and results we have collected we will be able to brainstorm anf plan our solutional prototype. 

### _*Skills*_ 

During my more specific dive into researching the fundamentals of customer service technology i was able to develop some of the skills i have  
already used before, along with cultivate new ones. Firstly i improved my ability to search using more specific keywords to get the specific   
hardware i was looking for (when i was looking for customer service hardware i kept getting hardware companies customer service agents) by using selective language and omitting certain words which i replaced with more specific versions. 
```
developed skill *-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
  using keywords to specify my research lvl 5 (+2)

```
On top of that i also improved my ability to selectively search for relavent data by putting my self in the shoes of a customer service worker  
which i found to help a lot in making my research more accurate to the topic i was trying to study. 
```
