### _*The Hardware and Software of Community service + sources*_ 

As easy as it is to believe, community service does include a lot of Hardware and Software. For the past few weeks, we have been collectively researching our topic regarding its advances in hardware and software and so far i have found that its very simple rather than complex for its extreme grey area. 

[hiver](https://hiverhq.com/blog/customer-support-tools) states that the majority of customers change brands after one negative experience with customer service, so they encourage the use and supplyment of hardware and software like [customer support tool](https://hiverhq.com/pricing) technology to help organize complaints, queries and requests. 
They also encourage the use of [help desk ticketing systems](https://hiverhq.com/helpdesk-alternatives) that allow customer service teams to log support tickets, streamline support workflows, automate the process of routing tickets to the right agents, and work collaboratively to reduce response time and deliver excellent customer service.

[liveagent](https://www.liveagent.com/academy/call-center-equipment/ ) states that the basic hardware a call center should have isâ€¦ 
1. Computers 
2. The latest Windows or Mac OS operating system.
3. At least 8 GB of RAM (more memory generally improves performance).
4. A hard disk space of about 280 GB.
5. Antivirus and spyware protection software.

And of course internet headsets and office space. 
  
In order to find these results I had to alter my searches and look from the perspective of a customer service worker trying to find hardware and software, which i found helped a lot.
