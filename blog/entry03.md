## Brainstorming and Finalizing my content 

It was pretty hard to conjure up a good invention to innovate the basis of Customer service, because it felt as though there was nothing you could improve upon. But using the skills i developed prior i came to the conclusion that there were a couple major problems within our current customer service methods. 

1. customers have complaints that struggle to be answered in a suitable amount of time
- sometimes, these long calls stuck with an automated response or a robot to keep you company are not very obliging. The waiting music is great though
- a lot of times workers who are supposed to answer these calls are too busy with physical lines they have to serve
- it is absolutely impossible for employees to answer the questions of many customers within a quick timeframe

2. Employees struggle with lack of respect in the workplace coming from higher ups and customers themselves
- customers can be very rude
- employees can be very rude
- overall the customer service experience has a lot of complaints coming on both ends

3. sometimes the establishment you are getting service from is not the best in the area
- customers struggle with finding a good establishment that can fulfill their needs
- employees might want a similar job in the area seperate from that establishment

### Brainstorming 

Based off of these problems, i found the components of customer service that could be improved on and could begin brainstorming how i wanted to solve them. 

The first idea i conjured for the advancement of customer service was AI assisted and pre-made responses to contribute a more effective help for the "help" pages of websites this could  be a universal attachment to websites and can also work as an app and have a "google maps'' like feature where stores can joint and receive their questions.  
It can possibly connect with job scouting websites like fiverr and work as an easier way to scout for workers and good jobs. After I received feedback and other opinions I came to the conclusion that a joint service software or essentially a more professional reddit would be greatly beneficial to forming a healthy company/employee/customer relationship.   
The way it would work is that a community can give feedback and provide a safer and quicker service. In regards to long waiting lines in service calls, it would be beneficial for both the customer and employee and make service more accessible. Mixing the fundamentals of these ideas can help provide the most effective platform for workers and service agents. 

### Finalizing my content 

Now that i had my final brainstormed product finished, i could finally get to work on my content. The way i wanted it set up was this, 

- what is customer service
  - here i would include my introduction to customer service itself
