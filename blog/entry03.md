## Brainstorming and Finalizing my content 

It was pretty hard to conjure up a good invention to innovate the basis of Customer service, because it felt as though there was nothing you could improve upon. But using the skills i developed prior i came to the conclusion that there were a couple major problems within our current customer service methods. 

1. customers have complaints that struggle to be answered in a suitable amount of time
- sometimes, these long calls stuck with an automated response or a robot to keep you company are not very obliging. The waiting music is great though
- a lot of times workers who are supposed to answer these calls are too busy with physical lines they have to serve
- it is absolutely impossible for employees to answer the questions of many customers within a quick timeframe

2. Employees struggle with lack of respect in the workplace coming from higher ups and customers themselves
- customers can be very rude
- employees can be very rude
- overall the customer service experience has a lot of complaints coming on both ends

3. sometimes the establishment you are getting service from is not the best in the area
- customers struggle with finding a good establishment that can fulfill their needs
- employees might want a similar job in the area seperate from that establishment

Based off of these problems, i found the components of customer service that could be improved on and could begin brainstorming how i wanted to solve them.
