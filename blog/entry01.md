### _*My Topic*_ 

   The topic i chose for my freedom project is customer service, because compared to my runner up ideas, customer service is a more general and wider concept to apply technology to. Theres so many ways we can improve on the already existing innovations to ease customer service. My runner up ideas that barely made the cut were writing and art, two things i like a lot along with customer service
   
Ever since i was young, my older sisters whom of which i admired worked many different jobs to provide for our family. I was always interested in working like them, and interacting with customers along with helping to assist them in their daily needs. This might be because of my upbringing in a family that rather than accepting the help of others, preferred to solve our problems independently and become someone other people can rely and depend on. So, it would be of great interest to build upon the customer service techniques and innovations by brainstorming technological concepts we can apply to make things easier, quicker, and overall more effective. 

### _*Sources*_ 

   There are a wide arrange of sources discussing customer service and the ideology of it (which is expected because its a topic with a lot of grey area), but it would be absolutely mad to scroll through all those pages, so with the use of keywords and filtering by credentials and relevance, here are the websites i found to learn more about my topic... 
   
   [blog.hubspot on technology and improving customer service.](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-service-technology)

   [freshworks blog on how to improve technology already rooted in modern customer service](https://www.freshworks.com/freshdesk/general/customer-service-technology-blog/)

   [cbs news - complaints on technological customer service](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/customer-service-getting-worse-new-survey-technology-customer-anger/)

   [buisness software on how technology](https://www.business-software.com/blog/how-technology-changing-customer-service-for-better/)

   in the majority of these sources, journalists discuss the concept of customer service, the problems we face with the technology, customer reviews, and how to improve on it. By filtering my searches with keywords i can easily get a nice image on what my Freedom Project will go over and brainstorm. 

### _*Engineering and design process*_ 

   The steps of the Engineering and design process consist of eight rules 

#### 1. Define the problem [x]
   
#### 2.Research the problem [x]

#### 3.Brainstorm possible solutions [ ]

#### 4.Plan the most promising solution [ ]

#### 5.Create a prototype [ ]

#### 6.Test and evaluate the prototype [ ] 

#### 7.Improve as needed [ ]

#### 8.Communicate the results [ ]

   Currently, i am on step 1 and 2. I have defined the problems that occur within modern customer service and am doing further research to expand on my knowledge. After i have concluded my research, i will start step 3 and 4 to begin the early stage of my website. 

### _*Skills*_ 

   Although this first blog may seem kind of anticlimactic and very quick, i learned so much and improved skills i have already developed even more. For instance, when searching for websites i could use as sources for my research, i had to find a way to filter through all the mess and junk that had no relevance to my research. This is where i used keywords to find specific articles that discussed technology and customer service.

```
   Another skill i developed was descision making. the reason for this is when choosing a topic for my freedom project, rather than picking one based on my favorite hobby, i chose one basecd on my likability, the amount of grey area the concept has, and whether or not it would be easy to brainstorm/research for.
